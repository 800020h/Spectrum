## Overview

Spectrum is a story-driven, exploration-focused magic mod.

Spectrum is progression-based and tries not to give everything away at first glance.
Each step of your journey will be hinted at through advancements and the in-game guidebook you receive as soon as you
find your first geode.

There is no hand-holding, so everything will require a fair bit of experimentation or exploration.
This also means that it may not be the best fit for everyone. Everyone plays Minecraft differently and that is perfectly
fine!

**You might enjoy Spectrum if you like the following:** Outer Wilds; Myst; Thaumcraft; Chromaticraft; figuring out how
and why things work

**You will probably hate Spectrum if you like the following:** Generic tech mod #7 with linear progression that tells
you exactly what to do at every step; following video tutorials 1:1

# Progressing through the mod

Find your first geode to get started!
Everything else will be hinted at via advancements and the guidebook you are given.
There you can find all the details you need to know.

**_Spectrum is not meant to be rushed. It is best played alongside your playthrough._**
