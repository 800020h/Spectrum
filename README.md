## About Spectrum
Spectrum is a magic mod about colors (The CMYK color space, to be precise).
It is progression based and tries to not give everything away at first glance.
Every step in your journey through the mod will be hinted at via advancements.
There is powerful treasure to uncover, but your path will be plastered with lots of hurdles - some of them more dangerous than others.

Your final goal? Discovering what's waiting for you beneath the bedrock floor.


## Getting Started
You are able to begin your journey to the spectrum mod as soon as you encounter your first geode.
This will allow you to craft your Pigment Pedestal, where most blocks and items in the mod are crafted in.
