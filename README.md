## Overview
Spectrum is a storydriven, exploration-based magic mod focusing on the natural energies that flow in the world, represented in color.

Spectrum is progression based and tries to not give everything away at first glance. Every step in your journey through the mod will be hinted at via advancements and the ingame manual that you will be gifted as soon as you start the mod.

## Lore
The world is interspersed with three kinds of fundamental kinds of magic: Time, Matter and Energy.
Where these magical energies overflow in the spectral plane they form manifestations in the physical realm, crystalizing as shards. You can find these phenomena in the form of gemstone geodes.

Your journey will be to go on an exploration journey to find out more about those energies and how to harness them and combine these basic energies to form all kinds of natural forces (color symbolism, basically, like lime standing for fertility).

Spectrum uses the CMYK color system to mix its colors: Amethyst as magenta, Topaz as Cyan, Citrines as Yellow.
You are an Artist of Magic, using natural energies manifested in color to form truly wonderful constructions and phenomena. There is powerful treasure to uncover, but your path will be plastered with lots of hurdles - some of them more dangerous than others. 

At first you as a player are just tinkering around with what is possible, but sooner or later will find out where the true source of these energies lies.
Your final goal? Discovering what's up with the magical energies surrounding the world and what is waiting for you beneath the once ipenetratable bedrock floor.

# Progression through the mod
Find your first gemstone geode to get started! Everything else is hinted at via advancements and the guidebook gifted to you. You can find more details in [Spectrums Wiki](https://github.com/DaFuqs/Spectrum/wiki). 

**_Spectrum is not meant to be rushed. It is best played alongside your normal playthough._**

## Design Principles
- Designed to create feelings of curiosity and wonder. Always hinting at what more there is to uncover
- Guidance through the mod is done via Advancements and its ingame book. All descriptions are atmospheric, immersively formulated as tips
- Everything should be somewhat laborious the first time (not to be confused with grindy!), but unveil a path, that makes the procedure much easier to follow afterwards
- Tools and blocks should not be overpowered. However, they are designed in a way that tasks that are not much fun - grinding good enchantments, repairing tools, mindless (mob) farming - are more easily dealt with.
- Polish, polish, polish! Even if it takes a lot of time. Magic mods thrive with awesome sounds and particles. Using your new toys should be fun, exciting and satisfying!
- There is no "one block does complex things". Each block and tool can only do simple steps. The individual blocks should be creatively combined to invite experimentation.
- Class before mass! Blocks and items, while not doing complex things, can do MULTIPLE things, but the individual tasks should be simple and immediately understandable. An item having more than one use makes it unique and memorable, after all! Like the crafting tablet, as a very simple example, acting as a:
  - portable crafting table
  - handheld autocrafter
  - crafting pattern in the Pigment Pedestal
