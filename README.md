## Overview
Spectrum is a magic mod about colors (The CMYK color space, to be precise).

It is progression based and tries to not give everything away at first glance.
Every step in your journey through the mod will be hinted at via advancements.
There is powerful treasure to uncover, but your path will be plastered with lots of hurdles - some of them more dangerous than others.

Your final goal? Discovering what's waiting for you beneath the bedrock floor.

## Lore

The world is interspersed with three kinds of fundamental kinds of magic: Time, Matter and Energy.
At positions where these magical energies overflow in the spectral plane they form physical manifestations in the physical realm, crystallizing as shards. These shards can be found in the form of gemstone geodes (the magentaish vanilla Amethyst represents time).

The first time the player stumbles about one of those geodes he starts going on an exploration journey to find out more about those energies and how to harness them.
As he finds more of those geodes, he learns that the energies can be combined to form all kinds of natural forces (color symbolism, basically).
Spectrum uses the CMYK color system to mix its colors (Amethyst as magenta, Topaz as Cyan, Citrines as Yellow). Combining these basic energies allows one to get a hold of all kinds of natural forces (the 16 vanilla colors; the energies stem from color symbolism, like lime standing for fertility).
At first you as a player are just tinkering around with what is possible, but sooner or later will find out that the true source of these energies lies beyond the bedrock.

The final goal will be to find out what is going on down there. A very dark, scary, but awe-inspiring dimension with monsters lurking in the dark.

## Design Principles
- Designed to create feelings of curiosity and wonder.
- Guidance through the mod is done via Advancements. The descriptions are atmospheric, immersive formulated as tips
- Everything should be somewhat laborious the first time, but unveil a path, that makes the procedure much easier to follow afterwards
- Tools and blocks should not be overpowered. However, they should be designed in a way that tasks that are not much fun (grinding good enchantments, repairing tools) can be more easily dealt with.
- Polish, polish, polish! Even if it takes a lot of time. Magic mods thrive with custom sounds and particles. Using stuff should be fun, exciting and satisfying!
- There is no "one block does complex things". Each entity can only do simple steps. The blocks should be creatively combined to invite experimentation.
=> they can do MULTIPLE things, but the individual tasks should be simple. Like the crafting tablet:
acting as a 
  - portable crafting table
  - handheld autocrafter
  - and as a crafting pattern in the Pigment Pedestal
  
But not do “X things in a row” that are hard to grasp. An item having more than one use makes it more unique and memorable, in my opinion.

## Features  (spoilers included)
- Additional, different colored gems with lots of building blocks
- More Tuff and Calcite block variants: Polished and bricks. Including slabs, stairs and walls.
- A new way of crafting using gems (also able to be used as an autocrafter for vanilla recipes)
- Different forms of decay - from tame to world ending. Handle with care!
- A possibility to get blocks that are otherwise unobtainable in vanilla. That includes mob spawners and a way to change the spawners data.
- Lots of magical machines and tools to help you on your journey, from useful to you to deadly to others.
